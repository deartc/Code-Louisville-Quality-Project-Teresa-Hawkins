#1: Test Plan

Introduction


Verizon is an Internet, phone, and TV provider that has one of the best retention rates of customers (churn) in the world. One of the main reasons is the website tries to engage customers. For this project, I have analyzed the hypothetical updated feature in the Verizon checkout. I have completed the following types of testing: functional, regression, and critical path. Regression testing is done to verify that the complete system and bug fixes are working fine. Functional
testing is done to verify that each functionality is working as expected. The differences between functional testing and non-functional are that the functional testing ensures it works as expected but the non-functional testing ensures that the application works good enough to meet the business expectation.  The non-functional test comes under a black box testing technique. Critical path tests are run to examine functionality required by typical users during their average day. These are the project requirements I completed: 1:Test plan presentation on the Verizon site, 2A: Manual Test Execution, and  
2B. a bug report.  I did the project with Microsoft Sway as well as a plain text version.
 


Scope 
 
Inclusions: The testing primarily dealt with the checkout process   I identified ten tests I performed on the website which falls into one of these major categories: critical path, regression, non-functional.  l included all the necessary components of each test case (preconditions, steps, and expected results.)
 
Exclusions:   The testing was restricted to this major feature, and I did not include more than ten tests, although other tests could have been performed.
