    #1: Test Presentation
 
Introduction
 
 
Verizon is an Internet, phone, and TV provider that has one of the best retention rates of customers (churn) in the world. One of the main reasons is the website tries to engage customers. For this project, I have analyzed the hypothetical updated feature in the Verizon checkout. I have completed the following: 1: a test presentation on the Verizon site. I have attached the test plan detailing steps I took. 2A:  I am presenting the results of my manual test execution. 2B. I am also attaching a bug report.  I did the project with Microsoft Sway as well as a markup text version.
 
 
Scope: 
 
Inclusions: The testing primarily dealt with the checkout process.  I identified ten tests I performed on the websites which falls into one of these major categories: critical path, regression, non-functional. l included all the necessary components of each test case (preconditions, steps, and expected results.) In each test the time limit was ten minutes.

Exclusions:   The testing was restricted to this major feature, and I did not include more than ten tests, although other tests could have been performed. The time limit was set by project.
 
1. HTML/CSS Validation
