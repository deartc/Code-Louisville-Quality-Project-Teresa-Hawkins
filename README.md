Test Plan  For Verizon 
  
 
Test Plan
 
1	Introduction
Verizon is an Internet, phone, and TV provider that has one of the best retention rates of customers (churn) in the world. This public source data set has recorded information about customers at the time of their contract renewal. This Verizon project has several objectives: The first objective is focusing first on customers that use Verizon website for their Internet service communication and what makes these customers more likely to not renew their service. I will analyze that with Power Bi.  I will also analyze a feature on the website for problems.  I will also point out if these problems might specifically affect  the senior sector. 


 
2	Business Background
Verizon is an Internet, phone, and TV provider that has one of the best retention rates of customers (churn) in the world. This public source data set has recorded information about customers at the time of their contract renewal. The Verizon website has been praised as one of the best for interaction with the customer.  They promote this interaction by frequent sales and free special event tickets.

 
3	Test Objectives
4	#1: Test Plan I completed a test plan on the Verizon site. I have attached the excel test plan detailing steps I took.
5	#2: Manual Test Execution I am presenting the results of my manual test execution. I have attached the following presentation detailing the manual test execution.

Inclusions  The testing primarily dealt with the checkout process
 
Exclusions   The testing did not 

The analysis also looked at one specific feature on the website.

QA Testing Course 1 - Project Requirements

To run the project do the following: Clone github.com/deartc/Quality-Project-Teresa-Hawkins. (Any other instructions I need to include goes here). The following Microsoft Office Suite programs were used:  Word,  Sway, Vizio, and Power Bi, and Visual Studio.  The project was done in C#.   The extensions used were C# and Net.  The NuGets used were xunit and others.    

Purpose: 
Verizon churn rate is one of the best in their market segment.  One of the main reasons is their websites try to engage their customers. This project examines the website  to see if it appeals to seniors or has flaws that might make this sector less likely to not renew their service.   A website  test plan is executed and  a bug report was filled out (hypothetical bug)  I used Sway for the presention and test plan.  I used Power Bi to  visually analyze Verizon churn rates.   


#1: Test Plan
I completed a test plan on the Verizon site.  I have attached the test plan detailing steps I took.

#2: Manual Test Execution
I am presenting the results of my manual test execution.   I have attached the following presentation detailing the manual
test execution.

I have included a bug report

I used Power Bi to visually display the Verizon churn  rate and how focusing on this Verizon webpage test might affect this churn rate.  The power bi pdf is :

1.	 Black Box Testing - Form Input and Validation I
  Verizon site checked for data input validity.  The allowed values in each field ● What happens when there are invalid inputs 

2.	HTML/CSS Validation 
Verizon was validated by entering its URL and checked by the HTML Validator extension for Chrome and Firefox. 
3. Cookie Testing   Verizon was tested with cookies enabled and cookies disabled to ensure functionality.   Geekflare was used for cookies’  security issues.

 4.  Link Testing To test for Verizon broken links, like Broken Link Checker to see if there are broken links. Several key links were also tested to ensure goes to the proper page 

5.Website Security- Verizon’s SSL/HTTPS connection was tested to make sure it's working properly ● CAPTCHA were checked  for proper functioning.   Invalid username or password were tested.  
6.Mobile Responsiveness Verizon site was tested using Google's Mobile-Friendly Test. 
7.  Accessibility Verizon  was tested against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).   W3C maintains a list of web accessibility evaluation tools that you can use to help you test your site
8  Functionality Testing  Verizon functionality testing was performed The following were tested : drop-downs, buttons  and process flow .
9.  Payment Gateways If you have an e-commerce store or other website that accepts any type of online payment, it's important to test payment gateways to make sure they're working. Most payment processors include some type of "test mode" that lets you perform transactions using dummy data.
10. UI Testing. UI testing on the Verizon site included checking  design consistency, screen resolutions and browsers.
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

#3: Unit Test Creation:
- Project Requirements

To run the project do the following: Clone github.com/deartc/Quality-Project-Teresa-Hawkins. (Any other instructions I need to include goes here). The following Microsoft Office Suite programs were used:  Word,  Sway, Vizio, and Power Bi, and Visual Studio.  The project was done in C#.   The extensions used were C# and Net.  The NuGets used were xunit and others.    
1. On the Vehicle class, add unit tests  and refactor where necessary.
2. On the SemiTruck class, I will implement all methods and write unit tests 
3. Add 3rd class, Car, implement it, and add unit tests for it. the first steps of the code are included here: https://github.com/deartc/CarSection.git
