 Scope 
 
Inclusions  The testing primarily dealt with the checkout process   I identified ten tests I peformed on the websites which falls into one of these major categories: critical path, regression, non-functional.   l  included all of the necessary components of each test case (preconditions, steps,  and expected resuls.
 
Exclusions   The testing was restricted  to this major feature and I did not include more that ten tests, although other tests could have been performed.
